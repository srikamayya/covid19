Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using COVID-19 india data set from January 2020 
	1.	Is India failed to take necessary measures?
	2.	Because of Population Density virus got Spread?
	3.	India have enough testing labs?

File Descriptions
There are 1 notebook(Covid_19_Data_Analysis) available here to showcase work related to the above questions.

Results
Findings of the code can be found at the post available
